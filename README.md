React/Firebase/Bootstrap Boilerplate
====================================

Requirements:
=============

## Firebase
Setting up a free Firebase account (https://firebase.google.com) is recommended for this boilerplate. Once you've setup your account, you will want to create a new project. Now that you have a new project, you can copy the config object from the `Add Firebase to your web app` popup and save it to `firebaseConfig.js`, see `firebaseConfig-template.js` for an example.
