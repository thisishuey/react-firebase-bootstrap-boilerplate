Requirements:
=============

## Firebase
Setting up a free Firebase account (https://firebase.google.com) is recommended for this boilerplate. Once you've setup your account, you will want to create a new project. Now that you have a new project, you can copy the config object from the `Add Firebase to your web app` popup then save and export it in `source/clients/firebaseConfig.js`.

## TODO:

* Clean up Firebase/client integration
* Add redux
* Add react-router
* Add TDD setup

* Add eslint
* Add Flow
